NBA 3D player pose estimation from multiple camera views!




Ideas to implement:
* camera extrinsics
    * use view of court with ground truth 3D court to estimate camera extrincs over time
* 2D player and basketball pose
    * OpenPose
    * object detection to get player + ball bounding box
* player identification
    * player bounding box -> face recognition, image to text, team classification
